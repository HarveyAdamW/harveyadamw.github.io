                <br/><br/>Some ancillary interests include machine learning, web design, education, particle physics, numerical optimization, writing, photography, cooking, and music.

                <br/><br/>The picture above is of me visiting a testing facility at the Brazilian Institute of Space Research (INPE). The visit was organized for the <a href=http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~highenastro class = "inline_link"/> S&#227o Paulo School of Advanced Science on High Energy and Plasma Astrophysics in the CTA Era</a> which I attended in June.</h2>
