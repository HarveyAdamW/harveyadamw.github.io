            <h2 class = "profile_text"> I am a PhD student at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), studying blazars and the extragalactic backround light. My research involves statistical analysis, scientific computing, and Fermi-LAT analysis.

                <br/><br/>Some ancillary interests include machine learning, web design, education, particle physics, numerical optimization, writing, photography, cooking, and music.

                <br/><br/>The picture above is of me visiting a testing facility at the Brazilian Institute of Space Research (INPE). The visit was organized for the <a href=http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~highenastro class = "inline_link"/> S&#227o Paulo School of Advanced Science on High Energy and Plasma Astrophysics in the CTA Era</a> which I attended in June.
                <br/><br/>On top of being a PhD student, I am also the Vice President of the UMBC Graduate Student Association (<a href = http://gsa.umbc.edu class = "inline_link">GSA</a>). I served as my physics deparment's Senator for 2016-2017. Giving back to and improving the community is very important to me. It is particularly important and needed in relation to graduate education. The stresses and requirements of graduate school demand a particularly close watch to ensure that education students and the University are both supported in an efficient, symbiotic environment.</h2>
